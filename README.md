# GPT Workspace Scaffolding Repository

![V1 of file structure](gpt-workspace-scaffolding/repoimages/Core_Folders.png)

## Purpose Statement

A file and folder structure intended to help those who are working professionally with GPTs. 

This folder structure is intended to be useful for those engaged in the following activities (a non-exhaustive list):

- Managing an inventory of custom GPTs
- Managing prompt outputs
- Managing a prompt library 
- Sharing any of the above

In practice, however, a **relational database structure** is much more appropriate and scalable for all of these needs than committing them to files. 

My [GPT Management System](https://github.com/danielrosehill/GPT-Management-System) is built on top of NocoDB and provides a framework for doing that (and it is very likely that many commercial cools will target this use-case in the near future).

But for other use-cases like proof of concept, sharing on Github, etc, this structure might be helpful.

## Documentation

For very cursory documentation explaining why the folders are structured like this, you can see `documentation.md` at the root.
